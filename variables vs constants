#this is a comment
#veriables vs constants
#veriables are decalred in titlecase
#CONSTANT are declared in CAPITALS

#example of veriable

Team1Name = "spero's stars"
Team2Name = "Croydon kebabs"

#veriables have a usefu; name
#veriabls store a value (can change)
#veriables can not start with a number
#e.g. 1Teamname = "Croydon kebabs"
#this will cause a syntax error

#veriable cannot ghave a space in the name
#eg. Team Name = "Croydon kebabs"
#tyhis will be a syntax error
#Veriables all start with capitals!!!!!!]

#this is an examplew of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The valuise is a CONSTANT do NOT change
